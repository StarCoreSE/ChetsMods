Shield Up/Down Detection

Storm Interference

Jamming

Transciever Pads, Reciever Pads, Transmitter Pads

Multiblock System
- Transporter Range based on Targetting Sensor Range
- Multiple Types of Sensors [Directional, Omni-Directional, Tight-Beam]
- Transporter Signal Booster Modules [Percentage Boost to overcome Storm Interference/Jammers]
- Transport Beacons/Areas
- Power Conversion Modules
- Transporter Control Panel

Transporters should be Frequency Based. Centerline and near center freqs should be ideal/stronger while fringe and super fringe freqs should be weaker, which can lead to increased transport/locking times, or locking failures.

Should be possible to scan frequencies for in-range pads

Tight-Beam sensors should be unjammable or undetectable unless directly blocked physically. 

Jammers should operate over a defined Frequency Range, which should be limited in certain aspects. Jammers could be circumvented by finding an unjammed frequency. 

Multiple Tiers of each block
